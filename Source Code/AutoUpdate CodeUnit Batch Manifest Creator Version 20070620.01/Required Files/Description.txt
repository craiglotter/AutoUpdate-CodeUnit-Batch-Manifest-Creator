AutoUpdate CodeUnit Batch Manifest Creator

AutoUpdate Manifest Creator is an application that generates the XML manifests and creates the zip archives for the CodeUnit AutoUpdate framework. AutoUpdate CodeUnit Batch Manifest Creator is a specialised application that basically applies AutoUpdate Manifest Creator to all my Work Projects, thus automatically generating all my manifests and download folders for me.

The Application works by applying AutoUpdate Manifest Creator to each project folder via a command line call and then moving all the generated manifest folders to a specified location for easy extraction.
